# ðŸ¥µ Data structures

In the updated version of the maTH library, we can also use historically well-known data structures, as shown in the table below.

| Data structure | Description                 | Source                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Stack          | Simple, LIFO type structure | [round.md](round.md "mention")     |
| Queue          | FIFO type structure         | [round-1.md](round-1.md "mention") |
| LinkedList     | Pointer based structure     | [round-2.md](round-2.md "mention") |
