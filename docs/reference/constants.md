# ğŸ˜³ Constants

Here are some constants you can direcly use in your code:

```cpp
std::cout << PI;        //3.14159
std::cout << E;         //2.71828
std::cout << PHI;       //1.61803
std::cout << TAU;       //0.61803
```

{% hint style="info" %}
With `setprecision(n)`you can display n digits of a number on screen. In the library, all constants are defined to the limits of `long double` (size varies from compiler to compiler, read more about this here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3454576/long-double-vs-double](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3454576/long-double-vs-double)).&#x20;
